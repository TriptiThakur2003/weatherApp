## Project Summary

This is a weather forecast web application built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It uses the **OpenWeatherMap** API to fetch current weather and 5-day forecasts. The UI uses **glassmorphism** styling and animated weather visuals. The app includes search by city, geolocation lookup, recently searched cities (saved to `localStorage`), a toggle for today's temperature unit (°C / °F), and custom error handling.
